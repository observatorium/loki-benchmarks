# loki-benchmarks

[![observatorium](https://circleci.com/gh/observatorium/loki-benchmarks.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/observatorium/loki-benchmarks)

This suite consists of Loki benchmarks tests for multiple scenarios. Each scenario asserts recorded measurements against a selected profile from the [config](./config) directory:

1. **High Volume Writes**: Measure `QPS`, `p99`, `p50` and `avg` request duration for all 2xx write requests to all Loki distributor and ingester pods.
2. **High Volume Reads**: Measure `QPS`, `p99`, `p50` and `avg` request duration for all 2xx read requests to all Loki query-frontend, querier and ingester pods.
3. **High Volume Aggregate**: Measure `QPS`, `p99`, `p50` and `avg` request duration for all 2xx read requests to all Loki query-frontend, querier and ingester pods.
**...**
   
## Prerequisites

* gnuplot

```bash
$ sudo yum install gnuplot
```

## Deployment and benchmark on OCP cluster 

* Connect to OCP cluster and make sure `oc` commands are working  
* From within `contrib` folder execute `deploy_loki_using_observatorium_yaml.sh` to deploy Loki  
* Run the benchmark using `bench-obs-logs-test` configuration  

```bash
$ make bench-obs-logs-test
```

* Results to be available under `reports\date+time` folder 

## How to add new benchmarks to this suite

### Developing

* Declare a new scenario with expected measurement values for each profile in the [config](./config) directory.
* Extend the golang `Scenarios` struct in [internal/config/config.go](./internal/config/config.go) with the new scenario.
* Add a new `_test.go` file in the [benchmarks](./benchmarks) directory.

### Run the tests

```
$ make bench-dev
```

Example output:
```

• [MEASUREMENT]
Scenario: High Volume Writes
/home/username/dev/loki-benchmarks/benchmarks/high_volume_writes_test.go:18
  should result in measurements of p99, p50 and avg for all successful write requests to the distributor
  /home/username/dev/loki-benchmarks/benchmarks/high_volume_writes_test.go:32

  Ran 10 samples:
  All distributor 2xx Writes p99:
    Smallest: 0.087
     Largest: 0.096
     Average: 0.092 ± 0.003
  All distributor 2xx Writes p50:
    Smallest: 0.003
     Largest: 0.003
     Average: 0.003 ± 0.000
  All distributor 2xx Writes avg:
    Smallest: 0.370
     Largest: 0.594
     Average: 0.498 ± 0.085
------------------------------
```

### Inspecting the benchmark report

On each run a new time-based report directory is created under the [reports](./reports) directory. Each report includes:
* Summary `README.md` with all benchmark measurements.
* A CSV file for each specific measurement.
* A GNUPlot file for each specific measurement to transform the data into a PNG graph.
